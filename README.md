## A note regarding `eisvogel_physics`

`eisvogel_physics` is a slightly modified version of [eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template), edited to include the standard physics Latex package.
All credit goes to the original authors for this.
Soon I will properly fork this and redistribute with the appropriate license.
